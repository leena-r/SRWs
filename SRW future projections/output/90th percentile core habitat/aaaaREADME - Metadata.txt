The shapefiles in this folder delineate areas of core foraging habitat (90th percentile habitat suitability) for southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) 
as modelled in the study “Out of sync: Climate change drives projected mismatches between foraging habitat and whale migratory phenology.” 
Core habitat was identified using circumpolar random forest models that integrated satellite tracking data with environmental predictors under present-day and future climate scenarios.


File naming convention:
[month]_[scenario]_90th_polygon

Month = Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar, or Apr
Scenario = present day, SSP1-2.6 (future) and SSP5-8.5 (future)


Usage notes:
To recreate Figure 4 in the associated publication, use the field “DN”, where:
1 = grid cells classified as core (90th percentile) habitat
0 = non-core habitat


Coordinate reference system (CRS):
WGS 1984 / EASE-Grid 2.0 South (Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area), EPSG:6932 (see .prj files for more information)
